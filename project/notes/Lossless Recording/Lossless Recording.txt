Making a superaccurate battle engine is difficult. Recording the frames for pixel perfect
analysis is near impossible without modding the game you want to record. Luckily, we have
access to this game and GameMaker actually comes with a way to dump every frame to PNGs.
Thanks GameMaker! These frames are saved to %localappdata%\<game_name>\frames. You can find
or change your game name using the instructions in the "Documentation" note. These frames
can be assembled using the following Python script:

```python
import cv2 # Video assembly
import os # needed for some file operations
import glob # used to discover frames

# HEY!!! READ THIS NOTE!!!!!
# I recommend playing this video back in VLC with the window resized to exactly 640x480.
# Otherwise THE VIDEO MAY BE BLURRY AND INACCURATE. THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE VIDEO FILE.
# You can take measurements using PowerToys and the screen ruler. That's how I do it, anyway.
# In VLC, you can press E to advance one frame

# paths
frames_folder = os.path.expandvars(r"%localappdata%\YourGameNameHere\frames")
output = os.path.expandvars(r"%userprofile%\Desktop\output.mkv") # The MKV file format is important here!!

# frames
print("Getting list of frames...")
frames = sorted(glob.glob(os.path.join(frames_folder, "frame_*.png")), key=lambda x: int(os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(x))[0].split('_')[1]))

print("done")
print("Assembling into file...")
print("This can take a while. For me, 16000 frames took about 10 minutes.")

if not frames:
    raise RuntimeError("error: no frames found in folder!")

out = cv2.VideoWriter(output, cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'FFV1'), 30, (640, 480))
# Explanation of the above code:
# output - the output filename
# cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'FFV1') - FFV1 is a lossless codec, great for this
# 30 - the fps
# (640, 480) - the width and height of the window
# You might have to tweak these values.

for frame_path in frames:
    img = cv2.imread(frame_path)
    out.write(img)

out.release() # done
print(f"SUCCESS: Video saved as \"{output}\"!")
```

Just make sure to replace YourGameNameHere with the actual project name.

Lossless Recording is disabled by default.
