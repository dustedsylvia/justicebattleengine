# Justice Battle Engine

This is the battle engine used in Team Ashes' fangames! It's a work in progress but meant to be as accurate to Undertale as possible.  
I've written a very basic documentation that is-you guessed it-unfinished, but you should be able to do some things by reading the documentation and looking through the code.

As of 11/9/2025, I DO NOT RECOMMEND TRYING TO DO ANYTHING WITH THIS ENGINE. There is so many things I still have to complete with this, and it's going to be a while before it's polished and ready for making fangames.
